 abstract = {Air dehumidification plays an important role in improving air quality and maintaining thermal comfort.
Increasing attention is paid to the membrane-based technology, which is based on water vapour transmembrane
transport driven by mass transfer potential, together with sensible heat transfer under
temperature difference. Membrane-based air dehumidification has been applied in heating, ventilation
and air conditioning, compressed air dehumidification and environmental control in space vehicle, and
some other engineering fields. This paper summarizes recent research results in these fields, including
fundamental principles, membrane materials, membrane module structures, operation conditions and
theory models. In the end, two methods of membrane-based dehumidification performance evaluation
are introduced from perspective of energy and exergy, respectively.},

@article{L.Z.ZhangJ.L.Niu.2002,
 abstract = {The performance correlations for the effectiveness of heat and moisture transfer processes
in an enthalpy exchanger with membrane cores are presented. The physical phenomena
relevant to the heat and moisture transfer in these devices have been used to develop
a novel set of correlations based on the relevant dimensionless parameters. The total
enthalpy effectiveness can be calculated from sensible effectiveness, latent effectiveness,
and the ratio of latent to sensible energy differences across the unit. Studies show that
the sensible effectiveness is a function of NTU, the number of transfer units for heat; while
the latent effectiveness is a function of NTUL, the number of transfer units for moisture.
The relations between NTUL and NTU are derived and studied with the proper separation
of moisture resistance for membranes. This newly developed dimensionless parameter,
NTUL, is to summarize the sorption characteristics of membrane material,
the exchanger configurations, as well as the operating conditions. A number of experimental
results on an enthalpy exchanger with novel hydrophilic membrane cores has been
used to valid these correlations.},

@article{LiZhiZhang.2012,
 abstract = {Energy consumption by air conditioning accounts for 1/3 of the total energy use by the whole society.
Cooling and dehumidifying fresh ventilation air constitutes 20--40{\%} of the total energy load for air conditioning
in hot and humid regions. Heat and moisture recovery from ventilation air has become a hot
topic for building energy conservation in these years. Of the various technologies for heat and moisture
recovery, membrane-based total heat exchanger is a promising alternative. Over the past 10 years, much
work has been conducted in South China University of Technology for the research on membrane-based
heat and moisture recovery, from fundamentals to engineering applications. In this review, the progress
of these researches is introduced. More specifically, some novel concepts are proposed for heat and moisture
transfer analysis. Several novel membranes are designed to accomplish the goal. Some novel exchanger
structures are constructed and the heat and mass transport phenomena is investigated. Novel
prototypes are built for engineering applications. The results are that a sensible effectiveness of 0.8
and a latent effectiveness of 0.7 are obtained for a total heat exchanger with novel materials and new
constructions. When the total heat exchanger is combined with a fresh air refrigeration dehumidification
unit, the system COP is improved to 5.8. The membrane systems have been extended to other areas like
air humidification, liquid desiccant air dehumidification, and fabrication of selective adsorbents. This
review gives a summary of these works and also points out the future research directions.},

@article{LiZhiZhangCaiHangLiangLiXiaPei.2008,
 abstract = {Parallel-plates enthalpy exchangers are one of the most commonly encountered energy recovery devices
that are used to simultaneously transfer both sensible heat and moisture between fresh air and exhaust
ventilation air. For such equipments, the water vapor sorption properties of the plate materials have
tremendous impacts on systemperformance. In this investigation, three different materials, namely, common
paper, CA (cellulose acetate) membrane and a modified CA membrane) are selected as the plate
materials for three enthalpy exchangers. Sorption curves and contact angles of these three materials are
measured to reflect their hydrophilicity. The steady-state sensible and latent effectiveness of the three
exchangers are tested in a special test rig, and the test results are compared with the model predictions.
A heat and moisture transfer model for the enthalpy exchangers is proposed. The effects of the varying
operating conditions like air flow rates, temperature, and humidity on the sensible and latent effectiveness
are evaluated. Both the numerical and experimental results indicate that the moisture resistance
through plates is co-determined by thickness, sorption slope, and sorption potential. Moisture diffusivity
in various materials is in the same order. So when the plate thickness is fixed, the higher the sorption
slopes are, the higher the latent performance is. Of the three exchangers, the exchanger with the modified
CA membrane material has the highest performance due to small thickness, steep sorption slope, and
large sorption potentials. The paper exchanger has a latent effectiveness of 0.4, while the membranes
have latent effectiveness of greater than 0.7.},

@article{S.KoesterF.RoghmansM.Wessling.2015,
 abstract = {While the permeance of membranes is typically constant for ideal gases,this behavior changes for non-ideal gases and vapors.
Due to swelling of the polymer,its simultaneous softening (plasticization) as well as clustering effects of the penetrant molecules, permeability becomes activity dependent. While most experimental investigations focus on studying the influence of feed activity,permeateactivity is often neglected. By means of constant-volume variable-pressure measurements we show the importance of both feed and permeate vapor activity for a system of pure water vapor and avariety of membrane materials. We find that a change in activity can enhance or reduce membrane permeability. Either feed or permeate activity was identified to determine the overall mass transfer. Additionally the membranes upportrevealeda significant impact on overall mass  transport properties. This is surprising since concentration polarization effects known from mixed-gas measurements can be excluded. After more than half a decade of water transport studies,well known systems still render transport properties difficult to comprehend. While we succeed to categorize types of transport behavior, fundamental questions on the origin of the transport complexity remain a challenge for future research. Identification of engineering relationships for further module and process development is established however successfully.},

@article{SDugariaLMoroDDelCol.2015,
 abstract = {The diffusion of total energy recovery systems could lead to a significant reduction in the energy demand for building air-conditioning. With these devices, sensible heat and humidity can be recovered in winter from the exhaust airstream, while, in summer, the incoming air stream can be cooled and dehumidified by transferring the excess heat and moisture to the exhaust air stream. Membrane based enthalpy exchangers are composed by different channels separated by semi-permeable membranes. The membrane allows moisture transfer under vapour pressure difference, or water concentration difference, between the two sides and, at the same time, it is ideally impermeable to air and other contaminants present in exhaust air. Heat transfer between the airstreams occurs through the membrane due to the temperature gradient. The aim of this work is to develop a detailed model of the coupled heat and mass transfer mechanisms through the membrane between the two airstreams. After a review of the most relevant models published in the scientific literature, the governing equations are presented and some simplifying assumptions are analysed and discussed. As a result, a steady-state, two-dimensional finite difference numerical model is setup. The developed model is able to predict temperature and humidity evolution inside the channels. Sensible and latent heat transfer rate, as well as moisture transfer rate, are determined. A sensitive analysis is conducted in order to determine the more influential parameters on the thermal and vapour transfer.},
